By clicking on the magnifying glass, Reaction allows you to filter eligible/group participants for easier querying.

Example: Let's say you wanted to add a particular participant to a group named Michael Smith to a group. It's pretty likely that there is more than one Michael Smith so Reaction has been designed to allow you to drill down as far as you need to using the **And** conjunction to find(or exclude) the participant(s) you are looking for.

Example: What if you want to find more than one participant at a time? Reaction allows for this as well using the **Or** conjunction
