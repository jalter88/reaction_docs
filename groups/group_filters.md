By clicking on the magnifying glass, Reaction allows you to filter eligible/group participants for easier querying.

Example: Let's say you wanted to add a particular participant named Michael Smith to a group. It's pretty likely that there is more than one Michael Smith, so Reaction has been designed to allow you to drill down as far as you need to using the **And** conjunction to find the participant(s) you are looking for.

Example: What if you want to find more than one participant at a time? Reaction allows for this as well using the **Or** conjunction

When combined with the **contains** or **equals** comparison,the **and** conjunction will return all participants that match **all**(less inclusive) filter(s) criterion while the **or** conjunction will return all participants who match **any**(more inclusive) of the filters.

Reaction also has the 'not_contains' and 'not_equals' comparisons for filtering out participants if you want to filter out participant(s) as well. However, only the **And** conjunction is supported. Try them out!
