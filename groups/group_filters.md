By clicking on the magnifying glass, Reaction allows you to filter eligible/group participants for easier querying.
Example: Let's say you wanted to add a particular participant to a group named Michael Smith to a group. It's pretty likely that there is more than one Michael Smith so Reaction has been designed to allow you to drill down as far as you need to find(or exclude) the participant(s) you are looking for.
