## Groups Details

### Groups

This documentation will teach you about **Groups**. Groups are closely integrated with Surveys in Reaction. 
Each Survey in Reaction is sent to a specific group created by you. Within a group, participants are able to added and removed
thus providing the flexibility you need to control which participants are associated with each survey initiative.

#### Participants

There are two subclasses of participants on a group.

  1. Eligible Participants
    * Global participants available to be added to a group.
  2. Participants in Group
    * Participants already assigned to the group.
