### Scheduling Surveys

You can specify a survey start and survey end date. This will change the survey status from scheduled to open, and open to closed, when that date / time comes. When a survey is closed, participations will no longer be recorded, and will not show up in any of your reports.

In the below screenshot, the survey's status will change to open on May 3rd at 4:00 AM, and close on May 12th, at 12:00 AM.
