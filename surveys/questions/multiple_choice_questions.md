## Multiple Choice

A key component of multiple choice questions are, you guessed it, choices. Choices in Reaction give you flexibility over 
what the user sees as well as what actually gets reported. This is done through labels and values.

  * **Label** - What the user sees on the survey
 
  * **Value** - What gets saved and used in reporting. Defaults to label unless specified by user. 
 
  * **Other** - By selecting the 'Include Other Choice' button, an additional field will be available on the survey labeled 'other'. This allows for the user to write in their own response if none of the available choices match their preference.
  
  * **Limit Selectable Answers** (Only present on a multiple choice many question) - Limits the number of selectable answers that the user can click. For example: You have a question that you want the user to be able to select two of the available four answers.
 
**Example**: You have a question named 'When it comes to vendor selection, what kind of research do you conduct?' with x number of choices. You designate the first choice label to be 'Leverage consultant partners'. You could simply save the question and the value used in the reports will be 'Leverage consultant partners'. However, let's say you wanted the value used in reporting to be 'consulting'. You can click the lock and change the reporting value to whatever you like. The value 'consulting' will now be accessible in the survey reports.
