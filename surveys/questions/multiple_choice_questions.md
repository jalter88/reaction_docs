## Multiple Choice Questions

This documentation will teach you how to effectively use a multiple choice/multiple choice many question in reaction.

#### Multiple Choice

A key component of multiple choice questions are, you guessed it, choices. Choices in Reaction give you flexibility over 
what the user sees as well as what actually gets reported. This is done through labels and values.
  * Label - What the user sees on the survey
  
  * Value - What gets saved and used in reporting

**Example**: You have a question named 'Pick your favorite movie' with one of the choice labels
called Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. You could designate the corresponding value to be 'star wars: the phantom menace' but, 
let's say you want to forget that Jar Jar Binks ever existed. By specifying the value to instead be something like 'star_wars'
you have changed what is reported (and what will be shown in the report) while at the same time removing one more instance of Jar Jar 
from the world. Good on you!
