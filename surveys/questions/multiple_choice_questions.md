## Multiple Choice Questions

This documentation will teach you how to effectively use a multiple choice/multiple choice many question in reaction.

#### Multiple Choice

A key component of multiple choice questions are, you guessed it, choices. Choices in Reaction give you flexibility over 
what the user sees as well as what actually gets reported. This is done through labels and values.

  * **Label** - What the user sees on the survey
 
  * **Value** - What gets saved and used in reporting
 
  * **Other** - By selecting the 'Include Other Choice' button, an additional field will be available on the survey labeled 'other'. This allows for the user to write in their own response if none of the available choices match their preference.
  
  * **Limit Selectable Answers** (Only present on a multiple choice many question) - Limits the number of selectable answers that the user can click. For example: You have a question that you want the user to be able to select two of the available four answers.
 
**Example**: You have a question named 'When it comes to vendor selection, what kind of research do you conduct?' with two choices. The first choice label could be 'Online search (ex: google)' and the next choice label could be 'leverage consultant partners'. You could then specify the value for 'online search (ex: google)' to simply be 'online' and the value for 'leverage consultant partners' to simple be 'consulting'. The answers will then get reported as the specified values and be able to accesssed in reports.
