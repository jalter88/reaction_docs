## Participants

How do you administer Surveys without recipients? The answer is you don't. Enter Reaction participants. 

### Searching for Participants

1. Searchbar
  * Available options include: First Name, Last Name, Id, External Id, Position Name, Company Name, Role, and Seniority.
2. Sorting
  * Each participant attribute can be sorted alphabetically

Example: Let's say you wanted to find a participant by first name Zeke. You could either click the magnifying glass and select 'By First Name' or you could click on the first name table header and sort Z-A.

### Adding Participants

There a few different ways of adding participants in Reaction.

1. Adding a participant manually by clicking on add a new participant (additional help documentation by clicking 'Add New Participant')
2. Participants can also be added from Peer60's existing database on a case-by-case basis.
3. Triggers (described in the triggers help documentation)
4. Importing a list of participants from a csv file (See Importing Participants)
