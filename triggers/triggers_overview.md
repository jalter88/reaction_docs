## Triggers 

This documentation will teach you about **triggers**. One of Reaction's most exciting features.

**Triggers** are automatable conditions that are evaluated at a specific interval. If the conditions are satisfied, certain responses(we call them reactions) are run automatically.

Currently, there is only one trigger (Salesforce: Case is Closed) available in Reaction.
To learn more, check the documentation inside the specified trigger.
