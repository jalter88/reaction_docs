## Trigger Details

### Creating a Trigger

There are 3 main details to take note of regarding a trigger.

  1. Trigger Name - Prefilled based on trigger type selected but customizable.
  2. Frequency - Tells the trigger how often to fire. 
  3. SOQL - Salesforce Object Query Language. Provides search filter control for filtering salesforce contacts.

**Example:** Let's say you wanted to check for a salesforce contact hourly with a specific email address.

By saving the trigger, reactions to the trigger become available.
