## Trigger Details

### Creating a Trigger

There are 3 main details to take note of regarding a trigger.

  1. Trigger Name - Prefilled based on trigger type selected but customizable.
  2. Frequency - Tells the trigger how often to fire. 
    * Example: Selecting 'Day' will cause the trigger to check daily for new salesforce cases that have been closed
    
  3. SOQL - TODO

By saving the trigger, reactions to the trigger become available.
