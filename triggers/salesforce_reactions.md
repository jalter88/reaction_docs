There are currently two available reactions to a salesforce trigger.
  1. Creating a participant.
  2. Creating a participation.

### Creating a Participant
  
##### By selecting **Create a Participant**, a dialog will open. Within this dialog are two main features.

1. Salesforce - Reaction Mapping (A visualization showing the participant/s that will be imported into Reaction.)
2. Additional Actions
  * Once the reaction has been saved, certain additional actions will become available. For example, adding the participant/s to a specific group.
