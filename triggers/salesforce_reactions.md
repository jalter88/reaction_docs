### Creating a Participant

2. Additional Reactions
  * Once the reaction has been saved, additional reactions will become available. For example, adding the participant/s to an already existing group.

### Creating a Participation

1. Attribute Mapping - A visualization showing the participant/s that will be imported into Reaction. 
2. Creating a survey participation - This allows for assignment of the salesforce contact as a participation on an existing survey.
  * **Example:** You have a survey called 'Short Survey'. By selecting 'Short Survey' from the select menu, a participation is automatically created from the imported salesforce contact/s.
